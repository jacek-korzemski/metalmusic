# MetalMusic.pl version 2.0!

http://metalmusic.pl/ is my blog, previously built on Wordpress, but now I'm working on migrating in to custom solution in Laravel. 

## Data migration

Most of data is already migrated from Production database. To migrate the data, I've used some Wordpress plugins to get clean MySQL query for new database. Laravel Migration are created in a way, that allow simple import.

## SEO Optimization

In every valuable subpage of the blog, I'm trying to add some seo details like meta title and description, but also, trying to speed things up, I'm using some PHP libraries for generating cropped thumbnails.
